I enhanced the webpage to look more like the real twitter webpage. 
- Added additional elements to top navbar with flexbox including search bar, button and links
- Used custom styled button pulled off twitter page for follow buttons
- Added box shadows to most components like twitter
- Modified profile info section to look more like actual twitter: added follow button and added a component for displaying all the users photos and videos
- To profile stats added the follow button to right of bar
- Added a recommended followers box on the right of the tweets like real twitter, which displays images and users of recommended folloewrs.
- Made the tweets component scrollable so it doesn't overflow off the page.
